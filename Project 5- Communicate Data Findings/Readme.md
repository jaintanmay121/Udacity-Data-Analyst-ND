## 2020 Ford GoBike System Data
### By Tanmay Jain

### Dataset
> The [dataset](https://s3.amazonaws.com/baywheels-data/202002-baywheels-tripdata.csv.zip) here includes data for all the rides made in February 2020. It contains data for more than 400k rides with 14 features each, such as start time of ride, duration of ride, user type, rental access method.

### Summary of Data Findings
> From the data exploration, it was noticed that people take bike rides mostly for their work commute. This can be said because the maximum number of rides were booked at 8:00am and 5:00pm, i.e. the arrival and departure office timings.
> The Casual users rides less often as compared to Subscribed users. However, Casual users travel more distance than Subscribed ones. 
> We saw that people tend to travel the least on Sundays as compared to other days. Most of the rides are booked in weekdays.
 
### Key Insights
> In the presentation, we can see the following:
<ul>
    <li>Most Common Start Point of a ride is `Market St at 10th St`</li>
    <li>For both types of users, the peak hours for bike rides are 800 hours and 1700 hours.</li>
    <li>The hourly usage by weekday for the two types of users.</li>
    <li>Trip duration for every day for a week shows that Casual users take longer rides than Subscribed users.</li>
</ul>
